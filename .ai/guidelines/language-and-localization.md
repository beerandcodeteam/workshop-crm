## Language & Localization Rules

- All technical guidelines, code standards, and documentation MUST be written in English.
- All source code (class names, method names, variables, comments, enums, etc.) MUST be written in English.
- However, ALL user-facing content MUST be written in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Labels
- Validation error messages
- Flash messages
- Alerts
- Notifications
- Button texts
- Form placeholders
- Tooltips
- Modal texts
- Email contents
- API validation responses
- Exception messages displayed to users
- Front-end UI strings

- Do NOT mix English and Portuguese in user-facing content.
- Do NOT leave default Laravel validation messages in English.
- If translations are needed, they MUST use Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) conventions and terminology.
- Avoid literal translations. Prefer natural Brazilian Portuguese phrasing used in real applications.

Technical rule of thumb:

> Code in English. Interface in Brazilian Portuguese.
